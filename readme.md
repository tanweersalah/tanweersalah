ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mohammad Tanweer Salah!

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Universitat zu LÃ¼beck, LÃ¼beck. My passion lies in the field of AI and its applications, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects in this domain.

ðŸ’¼ I am working at Fraunhofer IPK, Berlin, as a full stack developer, where I am involved in projects with Catena-X, focusing on developing efficient solutions in the use case of Circular Economy.

ðŸ’» With over 3 years of professional experience as a software developer, I honed my skills while working at Tata Consultancy Services in India. During my tenure, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Vision Works of America, a prominent client.

ðŸ”§ As a member of the development teams, I actively contributed to the Point of Sale and Customer Resource Management System. My responsibilities included bug fixes, creating new Azure Function Apps, developing Web APIs, and setting up CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps for efficient deployment processes. Additionally, I developed automation tools for report generation, enhancing the system's overall efficiency.

ðŸ’¡ One of my significant achievements was delivering a critical solution for data migrations, resulting in substantial cost savings of approximately 300K USD annually for the client. This accomplishment led to my nomination for the Best Performance Improvement Award in that quarter.

ðŸ“š To expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest advancements, I have completed the TensorFlow Developer Professional Certification and Machine Learning Specialization.

ðŸŒŸ I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to open-source projects related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development. Let's create impactful solutions together!
